# Smart-Inventory-Optimization
The 'Smart Inventory Management' system leverages advanced algorithms and predictive analytics to optimize supply chains, reduce waste, and improve customer satisfaction. By employing models such as ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), the system accurately forecasts demand, enabling dynamic stock adjustments that align with market trends. Additionally, clustering algorithms like K-Means and association algorithms help enhance inventory allocation and uncover product relationships, facilitating more efficient operations.
